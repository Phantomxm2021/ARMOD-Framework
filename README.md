# What is the ARMOD SDK?
In short, [ARMOD's](https://docs.phantomsxr.com/) solution is an AR experience platform solution similar to Snapchat ([Lens Studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/)) and Facebook ([SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/))! 

AR-MOD is a derivative framework based on Unity ARFoundation. MOD in AR-MOD means Modification in English, meaning: modification and module. This concept is widely used in games, corresponding to modifiable video games. Famous games such as Warcraft, Red Alert, Half-Life, CS, Victory Day and more! 

We transplant the MOD concept into AR technology to give users more freedom to create the AR creative interactive experience content they need! In this process, users do not need to worry about AR-SDK algorithm and code implementation, but only need to devote themselves to the production of AR creative interactive experience content. With only a small amount of code, you can use all the capabilities of AR-MOD on the APP to create greater commercial value.


# Enhance your world and applications

ARMOD is a powerful AR solution designed for artists and developers to build augmented reality experiences for hundreds of millions of Unity users. With its suite of Unity-compatible features, including custom shaders and advanced tracking technology, the possibilities are endless.


# Main features of ARMOD

<details>
 <summary>AR Basic</summary>

- Device tracking: track the device's position and orientation in physical space.
- Plane detection: detect horizontal and vertical surfaces.
- Point clouds, also known as feature points.
- Anchor: an arbitrary position and orientation that the device tracks.
- Light estimation: estimates for average color temperature and brightness in physical space.
- Environment probe: a means for generating a cube map to represent a particular area of the physical environment.
- Face tracking: detect and track human faces.
- 2D image tracking: detect and track 2D images.
- Human segmentation: determines a stencil texture and depth map of humans detected in the camera image.
- Raycast: queries physical surroundings for detected planes and feature points.
- Pass-through video: optimized rendering of mobile camera image onto touch screen as the background for AR content.
- Session management: manipulation of the platform-level configuration automatically when AR Features are enable or disabled.
- Occlusion: allows for occlusion of virtual content by detected environmental depth (environment occlusion) or by detected human depth (human occlusion).
